# Linux

In this post I am going to share my experiences about learning how to program in GNU/Linux
and why I think it is the best environment for that. Upfront I want to say that my
intention is not to express that my development environment is better than yours.
I have tried a couple of IDEs but they never quite left me satisfied. If you already
have invested a lot of time and effort to be productive in your IDE of choosing I
don't see a reason for you to switch to something else unless you wanted to try
something new for yourselft perhaps for the experience of getting an idea of how
other developers prefer to work.

I remember that when I was a student some of my classmates mentioned that software
developers prefered to write code in Linux, though I can only remember that not the
reasons. For me it just happened that I had to learn Linux to be able to conduct
my research work in a High Performance Computing HPC cluster. I had been a Windows
user since I was a teen and the idea of using a prompt like MS-DOS instilled in me
a sense of awkwardness. I just wouldn't know what to do with it and I was clueless
about its usefulness. 

My first real experience with the command-line was with Putty in Windows, for I had to
use secure-shell ssh to login to the Linux cluster. I remember spending a lot of time
walking through tutorials about using the command-line interface but for a while it
really did not have an effect on me, I was just trying to get my work done. At the
beginning it was a hassle in part because there was no seemless way to transfer files
between my machine and the Linux cluster, I did used a GUI based sftp client and then
also tried a command-line based client. As a consequence of that I started learning
my way with the command line in Windows as well, though I did not felt that the
experience of using it was great.

As time passed I eventually embraced the idea of trying Linux without
actually thinking that I would eventually switch entirely to Linux and never look
back. My first experience after installing Ubuntu was the feeling that my laptop
was unexpectedly more responsive and I really enjoyed that, it felt like getting a
brand new laptop with the latest specs without actually buying it.
